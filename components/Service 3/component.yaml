        AU-2 - Audit Events
        All AWS events are sent to AWS CloudWatch.
        This is implemented with our Terraform build using the
        `aws_cloudtrail` resource (https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/cloudtrail.html)

        A verification step can be done by confirming the existence
        of the Cloudwatch bucket etc. with InSpec.

        SC-1 - System and Communications Protection Policy and Procedures
        This text describes how our organization is meeting the requirements for the
        Security Controls policy, and also references a more complete description at
        the referenced document at
        https://github.com/opencontrol/freedonia-aws-compliance/wiki/Security-Controls


        Since the SC-1 `control` is to document and disseminate a policy on
        Security Controls
        this narrative suffices to provide that control. A verification step could be something
        that checks that the referenced policy is no more than 365 days old.

        SC-7 - Boundary protection

        Boundary protection is provided, in AWS, with Security Groups that do not allow
        ingress except to port 443 on the ELBs

        Verification: No security groups allow 0.0.0.0 inbound except ones named 'elb.*' can
        allowed port 443 to 0.0.0.0 (testing with InspecAws)
