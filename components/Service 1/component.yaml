      AC-1 - Access Control
       
      Enforce authentication and access control on all public interfaces and between service components. Avoid implementing custom solutions. Use IAM for service-level authentication and access control. Segregate access into multiple roles or utilise Cloud Service specific access tokens appropriate for the service to enable least-privilege operation. For stateful applications use well established session management patterns and proven libraries. Secure all internal service-level connections, preferably using certificate-based mutual authentication.  Validate external and internal authentication and access controls with positive and negative test suites.  Don't directly store or manage authentication credentials or role assignments in a service unless the service's primary role is to provide these capabilities. Storing internal singleton credentials to access service resources is acceptable as long as they are correctly managed.
